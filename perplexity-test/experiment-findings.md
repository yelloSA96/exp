content="I'd be happy to help answer your question, but it's important to note that the exact number of stars in the universe is currently unknown. Estimates suggest that there are between 10 sextillion (10 x 10^21) and 200 sextillion (200 x 10^21) stars in the observable universe. However, with the vastness of the universe, it's likely that there are many more stars beyond what we can currently observe. This is a fascinating question that highlights the vastness and complexity of the universe! If you have any other questions or topics you'd like to discuss, please don't hesitate to ask.",
