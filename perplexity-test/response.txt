To customize your Linux module on a Windows computer using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
1. **Windows Version**: Ensure you are running Windows 10 version 2004 or higher (Build 19041 and higher) or Windows 11.
2. **PowerShell or Command Prompt**: Open PowerShell or Windows Command Prompt in administrator mode.

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. Enable WSL
Open PowerShell or Windows Command Prompt in administrator mode and run the following command to enable WSL and install the default Linux distribution (Ubuntu):

```powershell
wsl --install
```

This command will enable the WSL features, download and install the latest Linux kernel, and set WSL 2 as the default. It will also download and install the Ubuntu Linux distribution. You may need to restart your machine during this process.

#### 2. Install Additional Linux Distributions
If you want to install additional Linux distributions, you can do so using the following command:

```powershell
wsl --install -d <Distribution Name>
```

Replace `<Distribution Name>` with the name of the distribution you want to install. For example, to install Kali Linux:

```powershell
wsl --install -d kali
```

You can also list available distributions using:

```powershell
wsl --list --online
```

To install additional distributions from inside a Linux/Bash command line, use:

```powershell
wsl.exe --install -d <Distribution Name>
```

For example:

```powershell
wsl.exe --install -d kali
```

#### 3. Set Up Your Linux User Info
Once you have installed WSL, you will need to create a user account and password for your newly installed Linux distribution. Open the Linux distribution (Ubuntu by default) using the Start menu. You will be asked to create a **User Name** and **Password** for your Linux distribution. This **User Name** and **Password** is specific to each separate Linux distribution and has no bearing on your Windows user name.

#### 4. Add Custom Linux Distributions
To add custom Linux distributions, you can import any Linux distribution using a TAR file or install using an `.appx` file. You can also create your own custom Linux distribution to use with WSL. Follow the instructions on the Distro Launcher GitHub repo to create a custom Linux distro package.

#### 5. Set Up Windows Terminal
Windows Terminal can run any application with a command-line interface. It supports multiple tabs, panes, Unicode and UTF-8 character support, and a GPU-accelerated text rendering engine. You can customize it to your preferences. To set up Windows Terminal:

1. **Install Windows Terminal**: Install Windows Terminal or Windows Terminal (Preview) from the Microsoft Store.
2. **Customize Windows Terminal**: Use the Command Palette to set up custom actions like keyboard shortcuts, customize the appearance, and more. For detailed instructions, see the Windows Terminal docs.

#### 6. File Storage and Best Practices
To open your WSL project in Windows File Explorer, enter:

```bash
explorer.exe .
```

To run Windows tools from within WSL, use the following command:

```bash
ipconfig.exe
```

For more detailed best practices, follow the guide on setting up a WSL development environment.

### Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues during the installation process, check the installation section of the troubleshooting guide provided by Microsoft.

By following these steps, you can customize your Linux module on a Windows computer and take full advantage of the Windows Subsystem for Linux.
