# Resume tailorer
The objective of this python project is to take a job description printout as markdown and align the resume accordingly to the job description.
To make this as a python library 


## First Attempt
Struggled with barely any support to run it FULLY locally. So I translated the embeddings to OPENAI while the other agents used llama3 instead. It managed to produce an output (interview_materials.d & tailored_resume.md). 
The output wasn't great and didn't tailor towards it.
